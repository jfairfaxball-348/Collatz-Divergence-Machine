# Roadmap

## CDM0 — SCAFFOLD AND CALIBRATION

**Status: COMPLETE.**

Governance, exact trajectory engine, ledgers, candidate model, cache, metric registry, transparent promotion logic, and a small deterministic end-to-end calibration are in place. No serious search was performed.

## CDM1 — STATE-OF-THE-ART BASELINE

**Status: COMPLETE — 2026-10-01.**

The durable audit is `docs/CDM1_STATE_OF_THE_ART_AUDIT.md`.

CDM1 established the external verification/provenance frontier, divergence-relevant necessary conditions, compute economics, preserved route kills, and the bounded CDM2-E1 calibration design. No high-range counterexample search was performed.

## CDM2 — FILTER AND METRIC DESIGN

**Status: IN PROGRESS — CDM2-R1 COMPLETE; NO E2 AUTHORIZED; LIFT-QUOTIENT THEORY AUDIT NEXT.**

Authoritative E1 report: `experiments/CDM2_E1_REPORT.md`.  
Aggregate result: `experiments/CDM2_E1_RESULT.json`.

CDM2-E1 tested theorem-conditioned length-24 parity-prefix classes against deterministic exact-K-survivor controls matched exactly on `f_K`, entirely inside the externally verified convergent domain.

**COMPUTATIONAL-EVIDENCE / FAILED generator result:** the conditioned construction showed no reproducible post-prefix survival enrichment. Debt magnitude and completed odd-to-odd valuation load also failed to add calibrated information after conditioning.

A bounded exact lemma established that for the declared 60-bit / `K<=24` calibration regime, every-prefix debt positivity is equivalent to exact no-descent through K. This explains why the binary debt predicate cannot rank correctly matched K-survivors.

**CDM3 is blocked. No generator is authorized from CDM2-E1.**

### CDM2-R1 — NON-TAUTOLOGICAL FILTER REDESIGN AUDIT

**Status: COMPLETE — 2026-10-01.**

Authoritative report: `experiments/CDM2_R1_REPORT.md`.

The affine correction was derived exactly and bounded tightly. At fixed `K,f_K`, `c_K` is an exact encoding of the already observed parity-prefix residue. For lifts `n=r+2^Kq`, the endpoint is `3^{f_K}q+b`; modulo any `2^s`, this is a bijection in `q`, so one fixed prefix admits every possible next length-`s` parity block across lifts.

At the existing `K<=24` scale above the current discovery frontier, the correction satisfies `c_K/n<2^-32`, while its actual contribution to the endpoint/start ratio satisfies `c_K/(2^K n)<2^-56`.

A secondary audit showed that quantitative smaller-preimage/path-merging "clearance" becomes an already-observed endpoint/start magnitude margin once the exact kill event is absent.

**Decision:** no cheap exact non-tautological persistence filter survived the audit. **CDM2-E2 is not authorized. CDM3 remains blocked.**

### CDM2-R2 — LIFT-QUOTIENT CONSTRAINT THEOREM AUDIT

**Status: NEXT.**

Audit whether least-divergent minimality, exact inverse-tree exclusions, or another already proved necessary condition imposes any nontrivial congruence or structural restriction on the lift quotient

`q=(n-r)/2^K`

for a surviving prefix residue `r mod 2^K`, equivalently restricting the next parity block **without computing that future block**.

This is a theorem/obstruction task, not a trajectory campaign. Do not turn it into broad modular feature engineering. If no such restriction can be proved, preserve the obstruction and keep CDM3 blocked.

## CDM3 — CONTROLLED EXPLICIT SEARCH

**Status: BLOCKED pending CDM2.**

Run a bounded multi-stage explicit search only if a CDM2 filter/generator demonstrates reproducible information gain beyond its conditioning event.

## CDM4 — STRUCTURAL EXTRACTION

Take informative growth anomalies and search for exact parity/residue/affine structures explaining them.

## CDM5 — SYMBOLIC DIVERGENCE SEARCH

Investigate structured families beyond direct brute-force reach with the objective of finding indefinitely reproducible growth mechanisms.

## CDM6 — ADAPTIVE SEARCH

Feed mathematical lessons from failed and successful structural candidates back into candidate generation and promotion.

## CDM7+ — ITERATE AS JUSTIFIED

Continue bounded research cycles. Kill unproductive routes rather than extending them automatically.

## CDM10, CDM20, CDM30, ...

Mandatory progress-and-correction audits.

## CDM-CERT — DIVERGENCE CERTIFICATION

Triggered only when a candidate has a plausible exact mechanism capable of proving unboundedness.

## Immediate next task

Run **CDM2-R2 — Lift-Quotient Constraint Theorem Audit** from `START_HERE.md`.

Do not begin CDM2-E2 or CDM3. Do not respond to the R1 obstruction by increasing K, trajectory length, candidate count, modular feature count, or hardware scale without a new mathematical implication theorem.
